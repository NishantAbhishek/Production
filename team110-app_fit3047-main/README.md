**About The Website:**

MovingEasy is a company that provides storage, removal and transportation

services for private customers as well as public and private enterprises. Other

individuals, including drivers, different members of the admin team, and manual

workers, play integral roles in the daily operational workflows of the business.

The main Activity of the business is to provide Transportation and Storage Services.

To provide these activities, the customer either calls the admin member or books in

person meeting. This is because, currently there is no alternative for customer or

admin to streamline this process. In the case of Transportation Task, a driver is

manually picked and designated to the job. Any update requested by the customer is

given by the admin member through looking at multiple paper works. Payment

records are then recorded in the paper based register.
